# cs50x-finance
A deployment of cs50x's finance project that I have successfully implemented in the cs50 IDE.
Test it out [here](https://keg504-cs50x-finance.herokuapp.com/login).
There are issues with database persistence currently, I am working on migrating to postgresql to solve the problem.
New users cannot be registered at the moment, but the following credentials work:

username: kevin

password: password
